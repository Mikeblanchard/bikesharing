## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to look at Citibike data from August, 2019 in New York City to find patterns for use in a sililar program in Des Moines, Iowa. We created graphics to illustrate to share-holders some key items, all of which we looked at in refernce to each other:

- Trip duration 
- Bike use by hour
- Bike use by gender

## Results

&#8593; This first graphic shows the location of most used starting locations of Citibike, represented by larger, darker circles. &#8593;

&#8593; This next graphic displays bike use by day hour for the month of August, again illustrated by longer, darker lines. &#8593;

&#8593; This graphic shows the trip duration. There is a very high spike occuring around the 5 minute mark, which tapers off quickly and levels out around 45 minutes. &#8593;

&#8593; Here we compare trip duration by gender. The shape of the graph is very simmilar for all genders. &#8593;

&#8593; This graphic is a more in depth look at Citibike use by time and day of the week. &#8593;

&#8593; Expanding on the last graphic, this heatmap breaks the Citibike use down by gender. &#8593;

&#8593; This graphic displays the usage by gender between short-term customers and annual subscribers. &#8593;

## Summary

Our two biggest take-away from this analysis was that New York City may have quite a few people who use Citibiike to commute to and from work based on the times that the bikes are used during the week, and the short nature of the duration of rides. This may be beacuse New York is a very densely packed, tourist city, and may not apply to Des Moines. Perhaps a study of another ciy, like Pittsburgh, with a population density of around 2500 people per square mile would be more valuable than a study of New York City, a population density of about 67,000 people per square mile. 

A few additional visualizations we would like to see done with the data available are a study of the ages of riders, in order to determine marketing strategies, and a reference to the most used bikes to allocate repair time and effort to the worn bikes.
