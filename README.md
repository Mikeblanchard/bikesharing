## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to look at Citibike data from August, 2019 in New York City to find patterns for use in a sililar program in Des Moines, Iowa. We created graphics to illustrate to share-holders some key items, all of which we looked at in refernce to each other:

- Trip duration 
- Bike use by hour
- Bike use by gender
